# .vimrc configuration


Welcome to my Vim configuration tailored for developing Node.js applications. After experimenting with various setups, I've settled on this minimal configuration that suits my needs.

**Important Note:**

> This Vim configuration is tailored to my specific needs and preferences, optimized for developing Node.js applications. I've intentionally omitted popular plugins like [coc.vim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) or [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale), which offer features like autocomplete and linting at the expense of increased complexity and resource usage.
>
> Instead, this configuration prioritizes speed and simplicity, focusing on leveraging Vim's native capabilities to enhance productivity. By forgoing certain advanced features and language servers running in the background, I've aimed to enforce a "Vim-centric" approach to coding, emphasizing efficient text editing and navigation.
>
> While this setup may lack some modern conveniences, such as advanced autocompletion and real-time linting, it offers a lightweight and responsive environment for writing JavaScript projects. You are highly encouraged to evaluate your own workflow and requirements before incorporating elements of this configuration into your own setup.
>
> Remember, the essence of Vim lies in its flexibility and extensibility. Feel free to experiment and customize this configuration to better suit your individual needs and preferences. And if you're new to Vim or have questions about specific aspects of this setup, don't hesitate to reach me out for assistance.


## Clone [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug.git)

```sh
curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
```

## Backup your current configuration (optional but recommended):

```sh
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc_back
```

## Set up the new configuration:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.vim/
git clone https://github.com/caesar003/vimrc.git ~/.vim/init
ln -s ~/.vim/init/init.vim ~/.vimrc
```

## Install the packages by running Vim

```sh
vim
```

you might get few errors here, but ignore those and proceed with `:PlugInstall`

## Enhance Navigation with Vim's Native Tag Support

If you want to further improve your navigation experience within Vim, you can utilize Vim's native tag support along with ctags. This allows you to quickly jump to function or variable definitions within your codebase.

### Install `ctags`:

Ensure you have ctags installed on your system. You can usually install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you install it with:

```sh
sudo apt install ctags
```

### Generate tags for your project:

Navigate to your project directory and generate a tags file using ctags. This tags file will contain information about the structure of your codebase.

```sh
ctags -R .
```

You may also add language-specific flags to the ctags command for better tag generation. For example, for JavaScript projects, you might add the `--javascript-kinds=+cf` flag to include functions and classes. Please refer to the documentation for ctags or language-specific plugins for more information on customizing tag generation.

### Configure Vim to use the tags file:

In the `.vimrc` file, you'll find a line similar to the following:

```vim
set tags=./tags,tags;$HOME
```

This line tells Vim where to find the tags file. Here's what each part of the line does:

-   `set tags`: This command sets the value of the `'tags'` option, which specifies the file or files to be used for tag searching
-   `./tags`: This specifies that Vim should look for a `tags` file in the current directory.
-   `tags;$HOME`: This specifies that Vim should also look for a `tags` file in the home directory.

### Navigate using tags:

Now, within Vim, you can navigate to function or variable definitions by placing your cursor over the identifier and pressing `CTRL + ]`. This will jump to the definition. Use `CTRL + i` to jump back to where you were. Additionally you can use `:tag` command followed by the name of the tag to jump to a specific tag

## Additional Consideration: Building Vim from Source for Enhanced Compatibility and Features

When setting up your Vim environment, it's worth noting that there could be compatibility issues if you're using pre-built packages from package managers like `sudo apt install vim`. Certain plugins may require additional support or features that are not included in these pre-built packages.

Moreover, features such as clipboard integration are often unavailable in pre-built Vim packages. By building Vim from source, you can ensure compatibility with plugins that require extra support and enable additional features like clipboard integration.

Here are step-by-step I took when I built my installation

### Ensure you have what it needs to build programs from source.

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt-get build-dep vim # this one is important
```

### Clone Vim official repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vim/vim ~/vim-repo
cd ~/vim-repo
```

### Configure Vim

```sh
./configure --with-features=huge \
            --enable-multibyte \
            --enable-rubyinterp \
            --enable-python3interp \
            --with-python3-config-dir=/usr/lib/python3.11/config-3.11-x86_64-linux-gnu/ \
            --enable-perlinterp \
            --enable-luainterp \
            --enable-cscope \
            --enable-gtk2-check \
            --with-x \
            --disable-gui \
            --with-compiledby="caesar003 - github.com/caesar003" \
            --prefix=$PREFIX
```

**Note:** Change `--with-compiledby` to your own name or identifier.

### Build and install Vim:

```sh
make VMRUNTIMEDIR=/usr/share/vim/vim9
sudo make install
```

#### To quickly get set and running, I've written the script of those commands above, which you can fetch and run

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caesar/vimrc/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Windows Compatibility

While this Vim configuration is optimized for Debian-based systems, it can also be adapted for use on Windows. Here are some considerations and tips for setting up Vim on Windows:

### Installation

1. Install Vim:
   You can install Vim on Windows using various methods. The simplest way is to download the installer from the official Vim website: [Download Vim for Windows](https://www.vim.org/download.php)  
   Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Chocolatey:

```sh
choco install vim
```

Install `ctags`:  
ctags is available for Windows and can be installed using Chocolatey:

```sh
choco install ctags
```

### Configuration

1. Vim Configuration File:
   On Windows, the Vim configuration file is typically located at `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\_vimrc` instead of `~/.vimrc`.

2. vim-plug:
   To install vim-plug on Windows, open a PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

```cmd
md ~\vimfiles\autoload
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim -OutFile ~\vimfiles\autoload\plug.vim
```

### Additional Considerations

1. Path Separators:  
   Ensure to use backslashes `(\)` for file paths in Windows. However, Vim usually understands both slashes, so you might not need to change paths in your .vimrc.

2. Building Vim from Source:  
   Building Vim from source on Windows can be more complex compared to Debian-based systems. Consider using pre-built binaries or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to run a Linux environment within Windows. WSL allows you to run Linux distributions directly on Windows, which can simplify the setup process and resolve compatibility issues.

3. Clipboard Integration:  
   Clipboard integration may require additional configuration. In your .vimrc, you can set:

```vim
set clipboard=unnamedplus
```

Ensure you have the appropriate version of Vim that supports clipboard operations. You might need to install gvim for full clipboard support.

4. Shell Commands:  
   Some shell commands in your .vimrc may not work as expected on Windows. You can use Git Bash or WSL to provide a more Unix-like environment.

Example Configuration for Windows
Hereâ€™s an example of how you might adjust your .vimrc for Windows:

```vim
" Path to the tags file
set tags=.\tags,tags;$HOME

" Clipboard settings
set clipboard=unnamedplus

" Other settings remain unchanged
```

### Generate Tags on Windows

To generate ctags for your project on Windows, navigate to your project directory in Command Prompt or PowerShell and run:

```sh
ctags -R .
```

### Summary

Windows users can successfully adapt this Vim configuration with some adjustments. Be aware of path differences, install the necessary tools using appropriate methods, and consider using WSL for a more seamless experience.

> **Note**: If you encounter issues, consult the documentation of individual plugins and ensure that all requirements are met.
